	<p>This visualization shows and interesting relationship between how frequently people vote and how that is realted to demographic factors such as income and education. From this chart, it appears as if people who always vote have on aver a higher income and education level than those who do not vote or vote sporadically. However, this chart only shows us information on these three cateogries. Voter behaivor might actually be driven by another confounding factor. As we looked at in class, older people are more likely to vote than middle aged people, so this plot might be reflecting this counfounding factor subtly. In conclusion, it appears as if there is a slight relationship between voting behavior, income, and education. However this does not mean that there are not other factors that explain and/or predict behavior. </p>
        
     	<h1>Bubble Plot</h1>
    	<iframe src="bubble.html" title="Voter Turnout: Bubble" width = "80%" height = "80%" 
    	frameBorder="0"></iframe> 
	<p> This bubble plot shows trends that are to be expected. First, in non-presidential election years, voter turnout is signifcantly lower than in presidential election years. In 2020, absentee voting was very high in comparison to previous years which is to be expected because of the pandemic. While absentee voting decreased in 2022, it is still higher than pre-pandemic elections. In 2020, there was also much higher percent turnout across all localities. While there seem to be no impact of region on voter trends, it is interesting that that largest outliers (with low absentee voting) are from the same region. </p>
